# Mikrotik_Scripts
Update Traccar from the Mikrotik GPS information.
Parts from the script are taken from other scripts as I am not a seasonned programmer.
A very usefull repo I've found was the one from Tim, it contained the gps-to-url script from which parts are taken.
The full link to the repo is https://github.com/timmay2/mikrotik-gps
