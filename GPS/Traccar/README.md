# Mikrotik Traccar updater from internal GPS chip
Update Traccar with info from the routers GPS information.

Parts from the script are taken from other scripts as I am not a seasonned programmer.
A very usefull repo I've found was the one from Tim, it contained the gps-to-url script from which parts are taken.
The full link to the repo is https://github.com/timmay2/mikrotik-gps
